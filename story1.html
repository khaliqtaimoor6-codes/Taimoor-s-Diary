        <h2 class="timeline-header">📅 Timeline: August, 1987</h2>
        <p>It was another regular day in the peaceful town of Wembleton, the sun was rising high in the sky, birds chirping and children going to school with their parents. In the town, there was a small family of four, named the Dorris family. Dorris, being the single mother of three beautiful little children named Henry, the eldest, Olivia, and Andrew. Andrew, being the youngest, was the favorite of his mother, always getting unreasonable favors and support from her, for which the other two might have been punished for doing the same. The children didn’t have a father figure in their life, and the most affected by it was Henry, because he spent most of his life alone. Henry was a genius like none other, though being such a highly intelligent specimen, he still had his flaws, obviously there is no person who’s flawless.</p>
        <p>It was Henry’s birthday on 8th August, the Dorris family invited the neighbours and relatives for the celebration of his birthday. He was turning 13, just the beginning of the teenage years. His father died in a road accident on a bike, apparently the reason was unknown whether he was overspeeding or it was someone else who hit him and escaped. Dorris, being a lawyer, was always unsettled because of what happened to her husband, her husband that she loved so much. That made her really overprotective of her children, making them live in an uptight situation.</p>
        <p>Henry was raised in Wembleton, so it was obvious that he was attached to the town. It was also his first year in Wembleton High. Summer was peaking, the summer vacation was really close and there was a silent anticipation, a quiet sense of hopefulness, in everybody’s eyes. Mr. Anderson was a teacher for years in Wembleton School, and Henry grew up in front of him. Both of them had quite a bond, because they were also neighbours. Mr. Anderson and Henry used to spend quality time together when Dorris was at her work. And Henry used to hide their relationship because his mother was really over-protective. In the evenings, they used to play badminton and sometimes baseball. It was like a father-son relationship. Mr. Anderson was a lonely person, living all alone in his house. His origin, or where he belonged from, wasn’t known to anyone and he kept it a secret close to his heart, what was there that caused him to live like that after all? Although what was known was that he was a genius, an intellectual whose brain power surpassed that of normal human beings. That being said, he was really similar to Henry.</p>
        <p>On the 8th of August, Mr. Anderson also started teaching at Wembleton High, it was said that he really loved his students. He was full of love for the people who were close to him. Now, as teenage life is really complex and full of emotions, Henry believed he was in love with a girl in his class who was a Black Muslim named Noor. Henry's mother was really strict about not marrying any of her children to Black Muslims. But love doesn't see race, culture, color, or religion. Henry told Mr. Anderson about her, and Mr. Anderson was supportive of him too, because he didn't believe in his mother's ideology. Mr. Anderson, after that, was constantly trying to set them up in the class. And on the 8th of August, both Noor and Mr. Anderson were also invited to the birthday party.</p>
        <p>There, Henry proposed to Noor in his room, in secrecy, to be his girlfriend, but Noor, being religious, rejected him, though the love existed between both of them. Mr. Anderson noticed Noor leaving Henry's room and Henry almost crying, came to Mr. Anderson to tell him about what had happened. It was about time for the cake-cutting ceremony of the birthday boy, when Mr. Anderson took Henry to his room. He was trying to convince Henry and help him feel better, and was hugging him tightly while Henry was crying, tears dropping and Mr. Anderson's coat from the shoulder side getting wet. He gave him time to unbottle all the emotions and cry as much as he wanted to, all the past trauma of his father dying, him being alone all the time, and him not fully enjoying his childhood.</p>
        <p>While all that was happening, things took a different turn when Dorris came into Henry’s room to call him for cutting the cake, when she saw both of them hugging alone in the room. It created a false perception of Mr. Anderson in her mind, because of her being over-protective she insulted Mr. Anderson and threw a drama and made everyone kick Mr. Anderson out of her house. Henry was still silent, processing all the trauma and drama of what was happening.</p>
        <p>There was a strong tension in the whole household and the party got cancelled, when everyone went to their houses, Henry finally came to his senses and confronted his mother about all the stuff that happened in his childhood. His parents fighting all the time, his father dying, and how he was left alone to deal with all this, and how he was so confined that he couldn't even love freely, and how Noor rejected him. He mentioned that during all this the only person with him was Mr. Anderson and told her all about their relationship. All the quality time they had spent together and how much he helped him. Dorris, being furious at Henry for insulting her upbringing of her kids, started breaking glass and wrecking havoc in the house. All the younger children, being traumatised by what was happening in the house, Henry left the house in a hurry to meet Mr. Anderson across the street, when a car hit Henry while he was crossing the road and escaped.</p>
        <p>Everyone came out of their houses in urgency. Sirens wailing throughout the city, the ambulance reached and took Henry to the hospital. Mr. Anderson wasn’t at his place when all this happened, he was furious about what had happened and was roaming around the town on his bike. When he saw the ambulance going past him and Dorris’s car following it, he immediately came to know something had happened to Henry. He also rushed to the hospital after processing all the stuff that had happened.</p>
        <p>When he reached the hospital, he heard the doctor saying to Dorris that the accident was really fatal and it caused a severe brain injury, and it caused a massive neuronal loss in the frontal and temporal lobes. Although survival was possible, personhood was not guaranteed, and specifically, “He may live, but he won’t be him.” What they needed was an O- blood type and someone whose DNA was closely similar to that of Henry. The doctor had already examined all of his family, but nobody was of any help to Henry, and that’s when Mr. Anderson spoke up, “My blood type is O-, though you don’t know if my DNA is of any help.” Dorris was really furious at first when she saw him, but she had no other option, so she remained silent. The doctor, after examining, told both of them that the strong cognitive patterns and similar learning structure of Mr. Anderson and Henry could really help Henry in getting better. Without it, it would be a profound cognitive disability.</p>
        <p>Thus, the teacher enrolled in experimental neural stem-cell trials to save his beloved student. The doctor warned Mr. Anderson that if the operation was successful it would cause problems for him too, such as migraines, memory gaps, and also the inability to teach again. Mr. Anderson, with no second thought, said, “I don’t care as long as Henry is all right and healthy.” He sacrificed a part of him that made him who he was, but it was all because of the love for Henry.</p>
        <p>Thus, the transplant and operation were a success, and Henry, as soon as he recovered, shifted to Washington with his family. Henry’s memories were hazy and he didn’t know what exactly happened back in Wembleton, so he started a new life. While on the other hand, Mr. Anderson was left behind, not even knowing where Henry went. Mr. Anderson, because of the trauma, was starting to become crazy, and he left his previous house, and shifted to a nearby town called “Wendi,” rented a small portion, and started living there like a crazy yet intelligent person. All of the symptoms started appearing in his everyday life when he found people like him, with different traumas but similar conditions.</p>
        <p>As time went by, Mr. Anderson, with three other friends, started to form a really close bond, each knowing what happened to them in the past. He told them about his dead wife, and later what happened to Henry, and how he was left all alone and stranded by those whom he cared about. All of them were empathetic to each other and were good listeners. They shared most of their lives, because they knew they didn’t have much time left, especially Mr. Anderson. Time went by, their drinking and smoking addictions started becoming more severe, and they were considered really dangerous individuals. Mr. Anderson’s false persona of him harassing a young neighbour and student was also spread throughout Wembleton and neighbouring towns, but now he didn’t care anymore.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Henry was thriving in high school and later even got accepted into an Ivy League college. There were certain triggers in his everyday life that made him remember things from his childhood, but his mother tried her best to make him not remember that stuff.</p>
        <h2>Timeline: August, 1994</h2>
        <p>On his first day of college, i.e., 7th August, he saw Noor in his class. She singlehandedly made all the dots connect, all the missing pieces of the puzzle solve, and made Henry recall what happened in Wembleton. He went to his home furiously and again confronted violently, “Why the fuck are you toying with me? Am I not a fucking human? Do I not deserve to have memories or even love, which you guys were never able to provide me? You guys even made me forget what I wanted to be in the future. I fucking wanted to study literature, but you literally tried making me an engineer?? Am I one of your toys??”. It was an emotional blast, he, in a panic, left his house and, not knowing where he was going, started running outside like a madman. The thought of him leaving Mr. Anderson alone like that in such a situation physically hurt him. He wanted to make up for the stuff he was forced to do, so he took a bus to Wembleton and left without any planning.</p>
        <p>He went straight to Wembleton High, querying about Mr. Anderson, but he came to know that he left the school in the same month that Henry left the town. The principal was quite an acquaintance of Mr. Anderson and believed that Mr. Anderson wasn’t at fault, so he asked his 12-year-old daughter, who was quite a fan of the drama that happened years back. She understood Mr. Anderson unlike the whole town, and told Henry the exact address where Mr. Anderson lived now. When Henry was leaving, the young girl said, “Your eyes, his mind.” Henry didn’t know what she meant, he considered it a random thing a child would say. He then followed the path the girl told him and went straight to “Wendi,” to Mr. Anderson’s residence.</p>
        <p>He saw a strange house, almost like an abandoned one, with graffiti all around saying “Pedophile,” “Get Out,” “You Monster,” and similar stuff. Henry, after seeing all this, automatically fell to his knees, realizing what he had caused him. It was totally silent around the house, he was worried about whether or not to go inside. He could quite hear himself gulping hard and was afraid of what to expect in the house. After a few minutes, he entered through the door which was slightly open. He saw trash all around, and it smelled horrible. Marijuana, cigarettes, and alcohol all around. In the living room, around a round table, he saw four friends drinking and playing cards, sitting on the floor, it was a Japanese-style low table. When they all saw him, they took some time to realise that it was Henry based on the pictures they had seen. Mr. Anderson was passed out, and the other three friends started fighting violently, throwing things at Henry and abusing him for what he did to their Boss Anderson. Though all of them were friends, Mr. Anderson, because of his intellect, automatically became the center of the friendship and was keeping everyone together.</p>
        <p>It took only a minute and a half till they got Henry in a rough situation where he was bleeding out, and Mr. Anderson came to his senses and asked them to stop. Mr. Anderson, still sitting at the table, asked Henry to sit on the side opposite to him and gave him some drugs. After a few minutes of silence, both of them, in the same situation, were hallucinating and seeing things. Everything felt weird to Henry because it was his first time consuming drugs and everything was in slow motion. That’s when Mr. Anderson fell down and twisted his back such that his head was under the table, upright, and went to the other table. Henry was surprised at what was happening. The other three friends asked him to check under the table. Henry lifted the white cloth and saw that under the table was an upside-down table tennis setup.</p>
        <p>Henry was hallucinating, so he was seeing everything spiral, and was still totally astonished at what was happening, and that’s when Mr. Anderson, from the other side, served the ball. Henry understood the game immediately and passed back the serve, thus not letting the ball hit the ground. It was like an opposition to the rules of the world and an act against gravity and life itself. Mr. Anderson, being a wild and madman himself now, started confronting Henry about what happened to his life after him, all the allegations, and also what his origin was and why he was the way he was, which was a long-kept secret, all while playing table tennis. Henry answered and told him that he forgot all about Wembleton, in conclusion sharing a wonderful experience all while hallucinating. Henry told him that he wouldn’t be leaving his side anymore, and that he loved him like he was his father all along and would continue believing the same.</p>
        <p>While all this was happening, Dorris came straight into the house with the police. Seeing the messed-up situation, she asked Henry to leave with her at that moment. Henry, being rebellious, asked her to leave, but she didn’t agree. The other three friends were already out through the back door, and that’s when Mr. Anderson and Henry looked at each other, nodded to each other, and ran straight from the back door to the bikes. All five of them escaped, an act of rebellion and bottled-up trauma given by society.</p>
        <p>Police following them, and them riding at full speed. Finally being free, and living life. Henry accepted his fate and understood what all of them were planning to do. All of them maxing out the speed on the highway, while death metal running in their heads, were prepared to finish it all. Henry singing, “Oh, we can be heroes, just for one day,” and Mr. Anderson finally screamed, “and we are finally ALIVE,” while throwing the bike off the cliff. They didn’t have much time together either, so they agreed to finish themselves by their own choice. Life was unfair, and they didn’t want life to kill them, that was a disrespect they didn’t want to take.</p>
        <p>The death of Henry deeply affected Dorris, and she changed her ideologies and made her other children live freely according to their choices. It was an event that could never be forgotten by the whole society, and how they failed all five of them. .It all ended, the same day it started.  All of them only felt alive when they were dying, and that’s how you know that it’s fate that plays with us all our lives.</p>
